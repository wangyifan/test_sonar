# Active Context: Java SonarQube Integration Sample

## Current Focus
- Initial setup of Java/Gradle project for SonarQube integration
- MathOps package with basic operations
- Addition tests implemented
- JaCoCo and SonarQube plugins configured

## Recent Changes
- Project initialized with Gradle
- MathOps and MathOpsTest created
- build.gradle updated for JaCoCo and SonarQube
- Default AppTest removed
- Memory Bank documentation created

## Next Steps
- Add tests for subtract, multiply, and divide
- Run SonarQube analysis with real credentials
- Expand math package as needed

## Important Decisions
- Use JUnit Jupiter for all new tests
- Use SonarQube and JaCoCo for all code quality and coverage tracking
