# Project Brief: Java SonarQube Integration Sample

## Purpose
This project is a minimal Java application designed to test integration with the SonarQube platform, including test coverage reporting via JaCoCo.

## Scope
- Java application using Gradle
- Simple math package with basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Unit tests for addition (others to be added later)
- JaCoCo for test coverage
- SonarQube setup for code quality and coverage tracking

## Goals
- Validate SonarQube and JaCoCo integration in a Java/Gradle environment
- Provide a template for future Java projects with similar requirements
